# MIDI Test Files

Some test MIDI files used in this package are provided by third parties.

   [official MIDI specification for the SMF file format](https://www.midi.org/specifications/file-format-specifications/standard-midi-files).
2. The files in the [`jazzsoft-test-midi-files` subdirectory](./jazzsoft-test-midi-files) were copied from the
   [npm repository for that project](https://github.com/jazz-soft/test-midi-files), and are provided under the
   [MIT License](./jazzsoft-test-midi-files/LICENSE.md).

All other files were created as part of this project and are subject to the license terms specified
